== Purpose

This project portfolio documents the work I have done as a developer of the *BoNUS* development team. It describes the
features that I have added and purposed. Some sections from https://cs2103aug2017-t09-b3.github.io/main/UserGuide.html[User Guide]
and https://cs2103aug2017-t09-b3.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html[Developer Guide] are extracted out to help with the
explanation.

== Project: BoNUS

**BoNUS** is a desktop personal organizer application dedicated to NUS students to carry out various tasks such as storing
contacts, scheduling for upcoming events, timetable planning as well as a calendar to better organise their campus life.

This project is the result of a semester-long software engineering https://nus-cs2103.github.io/website/[module] at
http://www.nus.edu.sg/[NUS]. It is built by my teammates and me, as listed https://cs2103aug2017-t09-b3.github.io/main/AboutUs.html[here].
Most of the backend codes are written in Java, while https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/get-started-tutorial/jfx-overview.htm#JFXST784[JavaFX]
is adapted as the frontend framework.

See our https://cs2103aug2017-t09-b3.github.io/[project website] or https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T09-B3/main[GitHub repository]
for more information.

=== Enhancement Added: Generic Property

==== Justification

All similar https://nus-cs2103.github.io/website/admin/projectList.html[products] have provided a few fields for users to
store their contacts' information. Our application *BoNUS* should provide something unique to stand out of them.

What if we provide the flexibility to allow users to define customize properties on their own? Different users certainly
have different requirements and thus would like to store different information about their contacts. The fields pre-defined
by the software may not suit their needs. Therefore, it is necessary to provide the `config --add-property` command to
allow users define as many customize properties as they want.

==== External behavior

Do you feel that the pre-defined properties in *BoNUS* does not suit your needs or you need more properties? No worry! You
can use `config -add-property` command to add a new customize property field.

Format: +
`config --add-property s/SHORT_NAME f/FULL_NAME [m/MESSAGE r/REGULAR_EXPRESSION]` +
or +
`cfg --add-property s/SHORT_NAME f/FULL_NAME [m/MESSAGE r/REGULAR_EXPRESSION]`

****
_(As shown in Figure 1)_

. You need to think of a short name for this new property (corresponding to `s/SHORT_NAME`).
. You should make sure this short name is unique, meaning that there is no existing property with the same short name.
. You need to define a full name for this new property (corresponding to `f/FULL_NAME`).
. You should choose an identifiable value for this full name because it will be displayed when you view the details of contacts.
. You can optionally write a constraint message for this new property (corresponding to `m/MESSAGE`).
. You can optionally write a regular expression to restrict the accepted value for this new property to be in certain
format (corresponding to `m/MESSAGE`).
****

_Figure 1: Add a new property "birthday"_

Example:

* `config --add-property s/ag f/age`
* `config --add-property s/b f/birthday m/Birthday should be in the format of DD/MM/YYYY r/[^\s].*` +
After adding a new property _birthday_, you can use it when adding a new contact. +
`add n/Linda p/85438796 e/linda@example.com a/5 Marina Bay Road b/Jan 29, 1987 t/friends` +
Now, Linda's birthday is stored as Jan 29th, 1987 (as shown in Figure 2).

[NOTE]
====
* You need to use the short name as the prefix in `add`/`addE` and `edit`/`editE` commands.
* You will see the full name when viewing contact's details on the right panel (as shown in Figure 2).
* You will see the constraint message when the input value for this property is not in the required format.

==== Implementation

===== Inspiration

Users should not be limited to the provided four fields, i.e. `Name`, `Email`, `Phone`, `Address` (we are talking about
the contact component here, of course one more `DateTime` for event component). They should have the freedom to enter all
kinds of information about their contacts apart from the pre-defined ones.

Through a brief product survey on other existing similar software in the market, we found that they usually ask users to
type all other information in the _so-called_ `Description` or `Details` field. This is not a good design because doing
so will make the information stored messy. The application is used to organize personal information conveniently. It is
a major drawback if the data are not stored (and thus presented to users) in a well-organized way.

Learning from many modern database implementations, we should think of the data as two tables: one for *contacts* and the
other one for *events*. Each table is composed of many rows and many columns. A single contact/event is one row, while
all their different properties/fields are the columns (as shown in Figure 3 and 4).

_Figure 4 : Add New Column in phpMyAdmin_

===== Design Consideration

**Aspect:** Where to store the "_metadata_" of different properties (short name, full name, regular expression, etc.) +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new class `PropertyManager` in Figure 5 +
**Pros:** Efficient (there is only one copy) and easy for future development since it is centralized. +
**Cons:** Requires major change to `Model` component and `Storage` component. +
**Alternative 2:** Store these data along with each specific property class, like `Name`, `Email` +
**Pros:** Able to adapt the current implementation of `Model` component. +
**Cons:** Hard to implement `AddPropertyCommand`, and difficult to manage as the project grows larger.

image::PropertyManagerClassDiagram.png[width="200"]
_Figure 5 : Class diagram for_ `PropertyManager`

===== Implementation Outline

. Create a more general class to capture the common patterns among all columns (all different fields/properties): according to
the basic OOP concept, a more generic class should become the superclass `Property`; then, other more specific classes
(like `Name`, `Email`, `Phone`, etc.) can inherit from it. You can reduce code duplicates using this design.

. Find a way to store the metadata of all columns (fields/properties): in popular SQL database implementation, database
server usually have a separate database reserved for the system itself. You have to store similar information somewhere
as well. Thus, you should create a `PropertyManager` to store these "metadata", including short names, full names, constraint
messages and regular expressions used for input validation. They are all `static` variables because there should only be
one copy of these "metadata". You will waste a lot of resources if you store these "metadata" with each instance of the
`Property` class.

. Deal with _Pre-loaded properties_: things like `Name`, `Email` and `Phone` are commonly used. Thus, you should ship
them with the application so that users do not need any additional setup steps to use them.

. Add new customize properties: you should provide a command (`config --add-property`) to allow advance users to add their
own customize fields (as shown in Figure 6). Thus, they should have the freedom to arbitrarily choose things like short
name, full name, etc. They can easily add/edit these properties of each contact stored in the application as well, just
like the _pre-loaded_ ones.

=== Enhancement Added: Import NUSMods Timetable

==== Justification

This feature addresses a specific need of NUS students, since they are our target users.

For university students, the lessons and exams reflected on their school timetable account for a large part of their
schedule. When they are using *BoNUS*, it is very likely they want to put all these activities into the application as
upcoming events. However, it becomes very tedious to do so manually.

Most of the NUS students are currently using NUSMods as their school timetable builder. Their NUSMods timetable contains
information about all their lessons and exams (as shown in Figure 7). Thus, it would be very convenient if users could
directly import their NUSMods timetable into *BoNUS* in one step.

image::NusmodsWebsite.png[width="750"]
_Figure 7 : NUSMods Website Interface_

==== External behavior

Do you want to get reminders for all your lessons and exams at NUS? Do you want to import your NUSMods timetable into *BoNUS*
automatically? `import --nusmods` command can easily help you achieve this.

Format: `(i)import --nusmods YOUR_NUSMODS_URL`

****
. You should directly copy the URL from the address bar of your browser, which should begin with `http(s)://nusmods.com/timetable/`.
. You should refrain from using the short URL generated by the _Sharing Timetable_ feature in NUSMods.
. You should see final examinations for all modules in your NUSMods timetable in the event listing interface (as shown
in Figure 8).
****

image::ImportNusmodsResult.png[width="400"]
_Figure 8 : Result of importing NUSMods timetable_

Example:

* `import --nusmods +++https://nusmods.com/timetable/2017-2018/sem1?CS2103T[TUT]=C01+++`

[NOTE]
====
* Make sure you have stable Internet connection when using this command.
* You may need to wait for a while as the application is retrieving information from NUSMods.
====

==== Implementation

===== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Relationship between `ImportXmlCommand` and `ImportNusmodsCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract `ImportCommand` class and let both of them become its sub-commands
(inherit from it). +
**Pros:** This is inspired by many popular command-line tools (like Git). `import` is called the actual command, while
`--xml` and `--script` is called the options. Most Unix/Linux users would be used to this approach. This is important for
us because we assume our users are typists and they are very likely to frequently use these command-line tools. +
**Cons:** Need to write extra codes and parsing also becomes more complicated. +
**Alternative 2:** Implement these two commands separately. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement and similar to other commands. +
**Cons:** Our users may not be used to it. The command word will become longer. It is not a good OOP practice as well
because common details are not abstracted into a parent class and this produces duplicate codes.

_(Similar strategy has been adopted in `ConfigCommand`)_

---

**Aspect:** How to obtain user's NUSMods timetable +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Let users copy-paste the URL as a parameter of `ImportNusmodsCommand`. +
**Pros:** Simple to use and easy to implement as well +
**Cons:** Need to check whether the URL is valid and from NUSMods (currently using regular expression). +
**Alternative 2:** Implement a built-in browser and render the NUSMods page +
**Pros:** Users are more used to this interface. +
**Cons:** Need much extra work to implement the built-in browser. The page may not be rendered well since the built-in
browser is typically smaller than OS browser and NUSMods does not fully adopt link:#mainstream-os[responsive UI framework]
and may not work well on a small browser window.

===== Implementation Outline

====== `ImportCommand` abstract class

You should create an `ImportCommand` abstract class and let `ImportXmlCommand` and `ImportNusmodsCommand` inherit from it (as in
Figure 9). It is also a good practice to use an enumeration `ImportType` because the possible types of the import
are within a fixed set of values. This leads to better modularity in `ImportCommandParser` as well.

image::ImportNusmodsClassDiagram.png[width="600"]
_Figure 9 : Class diagram for related import commands_ +

===== Parsing of NUSMods Timetable URL

You need to implement utility method to validate a given URL and parse the `GET` parameters. Although it is possible to
utilize external library like https://hc.apache.org/[Apache HttpComponents], it is better to implement on your own because
it is relative simple to do so and using external library comes with extra expenses (such as licence, etc).

[source,java]
----
public static Map<String, String> fetchUrlParameters(URL url) throws UnsupportedEncodingException {
    String query = urlDecode(url.getQuery());

    if (Strings.isNullOrEmpty(query)) {
        return Collections.emptyMap();
    }

    Map<String, String> pairs = new HashMap<>();
    for (String pair: query.split("&")) {
        int index = pair.indexOf("=");
        pairs.put(pair.substring(0, index), pair.substring(index + 1));
    }

    return pairs;
}
----

===== Fetch information from NUSMods API

The URL parsed just now only contains the module codes and grouping for each module. In order to add upcoming events, you
need more information such as module names, examination dates, etc. You can use API provided by NUSMods to fetch the
information you need. NUSMods API is in JSON format, which would be very suitable to use as https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson]
library in this project.

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Read JSON data from a given URL and convert the data to an instance of the given class.
 * @param url is the URL to the remote JSON data.
 */
public static <T> T fromJsonUrl(URL url, Class<T> instanceClass) throws IOException {
    return objectMapper.readValue(url, instanceClass);
}
----

===== Add upcoming events

After obtaining all the information you need, you can simply use the `addEvent` method in `ModelManager` class to add the
final examinations as upcoming events into *BoNUS*. This should be a similar process as `AddEventCommand`.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Import From BoNUS-specified Script file

==== Justification

This feature is meant for advanced users. To build an **epic** application, it is essential to build an _ecosystem_ for
the software. According to the _Unix_ philosophy, providing a shell scripting and command language is the minimum requirement
for a complete system.

With the support for scripting file, advance users (or system administers if **BoNUS** is used as an enterprise application)
can generate a scripting file and import it into **BoNUS**. Data management and frequent operations can be done easily in
one step. Otherwise, they have to type one command each time in the GUI interface, which becomes a very tedious work.

A sample script file is shown as follows in Figure 10.

image::ScriptFileSample.png[width="900"]
_Figure 10 : A sample script file_

==== External behavior

_(Coming in v2.0)_

Do you repeat doing the same set of commands again and again in *BoNUS*? Why not save them in a script file and import
it whenever you need so that you do not need to type all the commands again?

If so, `import --script` command is here for you.

Format: `(i)import --script FILEPATH`

****
. You must explicitly provide the `--script` parameter.
. You need to make sure `FILEPATH` ends with an extension of `.bo`.
. You should put **at most one** command per line in the script file.
****

Examples:

* For `Windows` users: +
`import --script C:\Users\John Doe\Documents\bonus.bo`

* For `macOS` and `Linux` users: +
`import --script /Users/John Doe/Documents/bonus.bo`

=== Enhancement Proposed: Export Data to Microsoft Excel^TM^ Worksheet

==== Justification

Currently, users can use `ExportCommand` to save data to a separate location as a backup. However, `.xml` files
are not considered to be user-friendly, as you can see from Figure 11.

image::SampleXmlFile.png[width="900"]
_Figure 11 : A sample XML file_

Thus, it would be useful to natively support exporting data to a format with better visuals. As stated before,
data stored in **BoNUS** can be considered as _tables_. Naturally,  Microsoft Excel^TM^ would be an appropriate format
to present data to users.

==== External behavior

_(Coming in v2.0)_

Do you hate reading `XML` files? Are you looking for exporting your data in *BoNUS to a reader-friendly format?

You can export the data in the application to an external file of Microsoft Excel^TM^ format now. +
Format: `(p)export --excel FILEPATH`

****
. You must explicitly provide the `--excel` parameter.
. You need to make sure `FILEPATH` ends with an extension of `.xls`.
. You should have installer Microsoft Excel^TM^ on your computer to open the exported file.
****

Examples:

* For `Windows` users: +
`export --excel C:\Users\John Doe\Documents\bonus.xls`

* For `macOS` and `Linux` users: +
`export --excel /Users/John Doe/Documents/bonus.xls`
