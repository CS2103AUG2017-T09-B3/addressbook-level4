. Download the latest release `[T09-B3][BoNUS].jar`, the sample data `[T09-B3][BoNUS]SampleData.xml` and test instructions
`[T09-B3][BoNUS]TestScript.pdf` (this document itself).
. A folder you want to use as home folder for testing **BoNUS** and copy the `.jar` you have downloaded there.

=== Importing the Sample Data

. Rename the downloaded `[T09-B3][BoNUS]SampleData.xml` to `addressbook.xml`.
. Create a folder called `data` under the home folder used for testing **BoNUS**.
. Move `addressbook.xml` into the `data` folder created just now.

==== Add a new property

To add a new property, we need to use the `config --add-property` command.

. Add a new property with the short name of `h` and full name of `hobby` +
Command: +
`config --add-property s/h f/hobby` +
Result: +
`Added a new property: s/h f/hobby`

. Adds a new property with the short name of `m`, full name of `major` and specify the regular expression constraint. +
Command: +
`config --add-property s/m f/major m/Major should only contain letters and it should not be blank r/[{Alpha}]+` +
Result: +
`Added a new property: s/m f/major m/Major should only contain letters and it should not be blank r/[{Alpha}]+`

. Set the value of customize property added just now in `AddCommand` +
Command: +
`add n/Linda p/89658712 e/linda@example.com a/School of Computing h/Programming` +
Result: +
`New person added: Linda Phone: 89658712 Email: linda@example.com Address: School of Computing Tags:`

. Verify the value of hobby has been set correctly +
Command: +
`find Linda` +
`select 1` +
Result: +
Linda's personal details are shown on the right-hand side of the interface. Properties are ordered by their full names and
each property takes one line. You should see the value of the row `Hobby` is `Programming`.
