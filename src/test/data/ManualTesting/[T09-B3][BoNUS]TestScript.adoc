=== Prerequisites

. Have Java (JRE) version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
. Download the latest release `[T09-B3][BoNUS].jar`, the sample data `[T09-B3][BoNUS]SampleData.xml` and test instructions
`[T09-B3][BoNUS]TestScript.pdf` (this document itself).
. A folder you want to use as home folder for testing **BoNUS** and copy the `.jar` you have downloaded there.

=== Importing the Sample Data

. Rename the downloaded `[T09-B3][BoNUS]SampleData.xml` to `addressbook.xml`.
. Create a folder called `data` under the home folder used for testing **BoNUS**.
. Move `addressbook.xml` into the `data` folder created just now.

=== Troubleshooting

== Testing

=== Add/view/edit/delete contacts

=== Add/view/edit/delete events

==== Listing of events
*Positive test case* +

the command listE.

_Command:_ +
`ListE` +
_Result:_ +
`Unknown command` +
_Command:_ +
`lIsTE` +
_Result:_ +
`Unknown command`

Commands are case sensitive.


==== Adding of events

To add an event, we need to use addE n/NAME dt/DATE_TIME a/ADDRESS of the event.

1) Adds a new event with Name `CS3201 Project Meeting`, DateTime `17112017 1530`, Address `School of Computing, SR09, NUS`


_Command:_ +
`addE n/CS3201 Project Meeting dt/17112017 15:30 a/School Of Computing, SR09, NUS` +
_Result:_ +
`New event added:  Event: CS3201 Project Meeting |  Date/Time: 17 Nov, 2017 15:30 |  Address: School Of Computing, SR09, NUS`


2) Adds a new event with Name `CS1231 Project Meeting`, DateTime `19112017 15:30`, Address `School of Computing, DR1, NUS` +
_Command:_ +
`addE n/CS1231 Project Meeting dt/19112017 15:30 a/School Of Computing, DR1, NUS` +
_Result:_ +
`New event added:  Event: CS1231 Project Meeting |  Date/Time: 19 Nov, 2017 15:30 |  Address: School of Computing, DR1, NUS`



==== Deleting of Events +

1) Deletes an Event with index 8 on the Event List

_Command:_ +
`deleteE 8` +
_Result:_ +
`Deleted Event:  Event: Project Meeting for CS2101 |  Date/Time: 01 Dec, 2017 09:00 |  Address: SR09, School of Computing`

2) Deletes an Event with index 11 on the Event List
_Command:_ +
`deleteE 11` +
_Result:_ +
`Deleted Event:  Event: Family Dinner |  Date/Time: 11 Dec, 2017 19:00 |  Address: Home Sweet Home`



==== Editing of Events
1) Edits Event from index 7 of Event list with a edited name of Movie Date with Bro
_Command:_ +
editE 7 n/Movie Date with Bro +
_Result:_ +
`Edited Event:  Event: Movie Date with Bro |  Date/Time: 22 Nov, 2017 22:00 |  Address: Golden Village Yishun` +
2) Edits Event from index 6 of Event list with an edited date/time of 18112017 15:00 +
_Command:_ +

_Result:_ +
`Edited Event:  Event: Family Lunch |  Date/Time: 18 Nov, 2017 15:00 |  Address: Sakae Sushi, Causeway Point`

At this point in time, Movie Date with bro should be at index 7 while

=== Import/export data

=== Advance setting

==== Add a new property

To add a new property, we need to use the `config --add-property` command.

. Add a new property with the short name of `h` and full name of `hobby` +
_Command:_ +
`config --add-property s/h f/hobby` +
_Result:_ +
`Added a new property: s/h f/hobby`

. Adds a new property with the short name of `m`, full name of `major` and specify the regular expression constraint. +
_Command:_ +
`config --add-property s/m f/major m/Major should only contain letters and it should not be blank r/[{Alpha}]+` +
_Result:_ +
`Added a new property: s/m f/major m/Major should only contain letters and it should not be blank r/[{Alpha}]+`

. Set the value of customize property added just now in `AddCommand` +
_Command:_ +
`add n/Linda p/89658712 e/linda@example.com a/School of Computing h/Programming` +
_Result:_ +
`New person added: Linda Phone: 89658712 Email: linda@example.com Address: School of Computing Tags:` +
In the meantime, a new person card belonging to Linda should appear in the person listing panel.

. Verify the value of hobby has been set correctly +
_Command:_ +
`find Linda` +
`select 1` +
_Result:_ +
Linda's personal details are shown on the right-hand side of the interface. Properties are ordered by their full names and
each property takes one line. You should see the value of the row `Hobby` is `Programming`.
